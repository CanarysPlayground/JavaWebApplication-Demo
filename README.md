## Overview
This project implements a **Simple Hotel Management Website** that allows hotel staff to manage reservations and other essential tasks. It is designed using Java 11 and built with **Maven**, with the application running in a **Tomcat 9** server. 

## Prerequisites
To run and build this project, ensure you have the following tools installed:

- **Java 11**: Java Development Kit (JDK) 11 or higher.
- **Maven**: For building the project and managing dependencies.
- **Docker**: For containerizing the application and running it in a consistent environment.
- **Tomcat 9**: The application server used to deploy the web application.

```

## Building the Project

To build and package the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```sh
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd <repo-directory>
   ```

2. Install the dependencies and build the project:

   ```sh
   mvn clean install
   ```

   This will compile the Java code, run tests, and create a `.war` file to be deployed on Tomcat.

## Running the Application

### Using Docker

You can run the application in a Docker container using the provided `Dockerfile`. This is useful for running the app in a controlled, isolated environment.

1. Build the Docker image:

   ```sh
   docker build -t hotel-management .
   ```

2. Run the Docker container:

   ```sh
   docker run -p 8080:8080 hotel-management
   ```

   The application will be available at `http://localhost:8080` on your browser.

### Using Tomcat

Alternatively, you can deploy the `.war` file generated by Maven to your Tomcat server.

1. Copy the `.war` file from the `target/` directory to your Tomcat `webapps/` directory.
2. Start Tomcat and navigate to `http://localhost:8080/<your-app-name>` to access the application.

## Configuration

- **Database**: Ensure the database connection (if applicable) is correctly configured for the application to manage hotel reservations and other data.
- **Security**: The project includes ZAP scanning configurations (`.zap/rules.tsv` and `ruleset.xml`) to ensure security best practices.
